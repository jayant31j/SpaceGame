Lost In Space (C++ Game Development)

Lost In Space is my first C++ game, developed during my university studies. This project served as a foundational experience in game development, allowing me to apply core programming concepts to create an interactive and engaging experience.

Key Features & Learning Outcomes:

Core Game Mechanics: Implemented essential gameplay elements including player movement (spaceship), resource management (fuel, nitro, shields), and collectible items (coins, diamonds, hearts, power-ups).

Object-Oriented Design: Utilized C++'s object-oriented capabilities to structure game entities (player, enemies, collectibles) and their interactions, promoting modularity and maintainability.

Resource Management & UI: Developed a clear user interface to display vital player statistics such as fuel, nitro, and shield levels, and integrated collectible items that replenish or enhance these resources.

Collision Detection (Implied): Designed interactions between the player and various in-game objects, likely involving basic collision detection for collecting items and managing resources.

First Game Development Experience: This project provided invaluable hands-on experience with the entire game development pipeline, from initial design and implementation to basic debugging and iteration, solidifying my understanding of game logic and C++ programming in a practical context.
